This is the first exercise of neuro-photonics course. In this exercise I built a function calculating NIRS from data of 20 channels with 2 wavelength and give dHbO and dHbR of those channels. the function file called "CalcNIRS.m".

I run this function on two data files and plotted the dHbO and dHbR of some of the channels. I plotted also a FT of dHbs of one of the channels. The main code do that is "Ex1_main.m"
